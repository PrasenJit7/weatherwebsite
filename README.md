## Reflection ##
This project taught me a great deal on the importance of organizing the files and functions. Keeping everything in one big file started to become overwhelming and difficult to manage properly well. By breaking the big file into multiple, I was able to better stay organize. 

Another challenge that I faced was the urge to just get it over with. As I reach to the end, I felt more annoyed that I haven't finished this project yet. The state of the mood produces the type of work created in that mood. My annoyance led to messier code, less organized files, a careless attitude with the worsening of the code and design, and wanting to simply get it over with. *I learned that in this situation, I really needed to give myself breaks away from programming. I needed time to think, to plan, to do some brainstorming rather than sit in front of a computer.*

I believe what had contributed the most to create this project to the level of standard I wanted was the early prototyping I done before starting the project. I first sketched on paper, brainstorm ideas, and the functions that I needed - but none of this is enough until I had a really clear idea of how everything will look. CSS and HTML are great time absorbers and I find myself easily being stucked in a state of no progress when I didn't have any clear picture on how the website should look. Coming to the rescue, Adobe XD saves me allow me to see the colors that I needed, the resuable classes I can use, the overall layout of the HTML, and the organization of files.  For me, this has been the greatest beneficial change. 

I also rated my programming sessions every time and wrote the goal for my next session. Each session can be about 10 - 60 minutes. What this has done was made me see how I was using my time. Was I being effective? Or do I need a break? Am I productive? Am I lacking a plan? When I neglected this, it usually means my programming session that day does not reach the fulfillment and productivity with it. This has been a great change into my programming, a beneficial one. 

Overall, I am really happy with the outcome of this project. It was only the two three days before the completion of this project that I decided to change some of my designs and was able to make it look good and well in this current state. This project has reached the level of standards I expected in myself and a push that further my potential in web development. Though I will say, programming is one quick way to get anti-social and blind before 40s. Was it worth my time to have spent it in this weather app? Indeed it was worth it. 

## Improvements I will make into my next project ##
* Always do planning beforehand. I will do: brainstorming, planning features, sketching, prototyping on Adobe XD, breaking down the JS code, and back to planning. Planning, Planning, Planning. I will spend a entire day dedicated towards planning (which will greatly save me a huge amount of time)
* Spend about 5 minutes breaking down how I will use my time: what is my end goal.
* Write goal down for every session and rate myself each session 
* Elimination of distractions. Do only one single task at a time. keep phone away. 
* TAKE BREAKS when I feel myself getting overwhelmed. Quit programming when I know I am not in the right mood. Walk away. Use your time better.
